## Environment variables

This project uses environment variables for database connections, API keys, and other secrets.

To get started locally:

1. Copy the example file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Edit `.env.local` and replace the `REPLACE_WITH_*` placeholders with your real credentials (for example, your database password or Supabase keys).

3. Keep `.env.local` out of version control — it should never be committed. The repository provides `.env.example` with placeholders so contributors know what keys are required.

Notes:
- For production and CI, add environment variables using your host's secret management (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Actions Secrets, etc.).
- If you use a Postgres database with Prisma, set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local` before running migrations.
